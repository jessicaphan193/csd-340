                <p class="card-desc">Journaling is something I like to do on my free time. I think it's one of the best way to relax and unwind sometime after a long day. It's also great for taking care of your mental health. If you're someone who's already write down their thoughts, this is one way to take it up a notch and make it cutesy.</p>

                <p class="card-desc">Whenever I go on trips, I like to take my Instax camera to take photo and remember the places I visit. What makes these different than ordinary cameras is that the photo will be printed in small version which makes it easy to take it anywhere on the go.</p>

I think it has to do with attending more concerts recently this year.</p>

                        <p>Working at ShareTea was one of the best jobs I have ever worked at. Although my time there wasn't long, it feels pretty cool to know I was part of the original team that started when it first opened. At ShareTea I want to say I worked there just barely over one and a half years.</p>
